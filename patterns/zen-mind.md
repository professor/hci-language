**Programming is a mentally-demanding task. And when programmers make mistakes, their computers compound them.**

Programming is a mentally-demanding task. During a typical work week, a programmer
not only has to keep straight hundreds of facts about the system they work on, but
understand the relationships between them as well. If a presumed fact is later found not
to be true, or not to be true in all circumstances, many other assumptions usually
need to be checked, as they may have relied implicitly on the falsified fact.
The more complex the system being programmed, the harder it is for people to do this
type of mental bookkeeping reliably. 

Most of the patterns in this language focus on *eliminating needless complexity*
rather than improving people's cognitive abilities. The simple reason for this is
that computer systems are often orders of magnitude more complex than what a person
can keep in their conscious awareness. It is just not possible to fit large
computer systems in our heads all at once.

This pattern examines the question: given that we work on systems that do *not*
fit in our heads, what is the best frame of mind to be in
when programming? What does "appropriate discipline" look like?

- Beginner's mind
- Open mind
- Simultaneous focus and awareness
- Avoid attachment to existing solutions
- Ask "why are we doing it this way?"

## Examples

Gratitude can create Beginner's Mind—because gratitude implies not taking something
for granted, the thing feels new.

Today I ran a teambuilding exercise at work that I've facilitated many times in the
past, in different contexts. Part of my opening spiel for the exercise is to let
people know they are free to take a break at any point and get food or a drink.
So I pointed out the snack cupboard, loaded with free snacks, about 20 feet away
from where we were sitting. I realized as I did this that it was kind of silly.
I was talking to my coworkers and they all knew perfectly well where the snacks were
and that they were free to take some. But it made me think back to all the other times
I've run the exercise when the snacks *weren't* free, when some volunteer drove
across town to buy them and bring them back... it made the whole situation seem
new and fresh, because I had suddenly noticed the extraordinary good fortune of my
situation.
