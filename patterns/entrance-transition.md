# Entrance Transition

{Summary} 

---

**Software experiences, especially personal webpages, are most
tranquil when they are separated from public or commercial experiences
by a transition page.**

TODO: I don't know why this pattern happens, but I see it a lot.

{Problem description}

**Create a transition screen or page between a public, unfocused
(e.g. browsing) experience and a personal, focused (e.g. reading)
experience. Keep the content on the transition screen minimal, and
do not offer any choices besides proceeding to the content or
returning to browsing. Give the viewer something to focus on visually;
a short quote, an image.**

{Solution description}

## Examples

Many homepages on the web, both old and new, use this pattern.
See https://neocities.org for examples.
